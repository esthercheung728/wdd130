        <div class="river1_1">Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</div>
        <div class="river1_2">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The
            Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
            number of
            folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.</div>


        <div class="river1_3">Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep
            are also
            commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower
            over
            the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.</div>

        <div class="river1_4">Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
            undammed
            rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the
            early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
            summer...but
            families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water
            more.</div>

        <div class="river2_1">Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</div>
        <div class="river2_2">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the
            Green river
            flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery,
            and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid
            (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations,
            evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</div>

        <div class="river2_3">Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days</div>

        <div class="river2_4">Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on
            the
            uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</div>

    <div class="river3">
        <img class="card-img4" src="images/littlecolorado.jpg" alt="Grand Canyon in Arizona">
        <div class="river3_1">Grand Canyon, Arizona</div>
        <div class="river3_2">This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will
            never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.</div>

        <div class="river3_3">Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to
            make one truly
            unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but
            with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.</div>

        <div class="river3_4">CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon
            are technically
            rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most
            people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</div>
