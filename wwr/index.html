            <h2>Meanings</h2>
            <p>The festival celebrates three fundamental concepts that are closely connected:

                Gathering: Such as family and friends coming together, or harvesting crops for the festival. It is
                said that the Moon is the brightest and roundest on this day which means family reunion.
                Consequently, this is the main reason the festival is considered important.
                Giving thanks: To give thanks for the harvest, or for harmonious unions
                Praying (asking for conceptual or material satisfaction): Praying for things such as babies, a
                spouse, beauty, longevity, or a good future
                Traditions and myths surrounding the festival are formed around these concepts,[13] although
                traditions have changed over time due to changes in technology, science, economy, culture, and
                religion. It's about well-being together.</p>

                <h2>Moon Cakes</h2>
                <p>Making and sharing mooncakes is one of the hallmark traditions of this festival. In Chinese culture,
                    a round shape symbolizes completeness and reunion. Thus, the sharing and eating of round mooncakes
                    among family members during the week of the festival signifies the completeness and unity of
                    families. In some areas of China, there is a tradition of making mooncakes during the night of the
                    Mid-Autumn Festival. The senior person in that household would cut the mooncakes into pieces and
                    distribute them to each family member, signifying a family reunion. In modern times, however, making
                    mooncakes at home has given way to the more popular custom of giving mooncakes to family members,
                    although the meaning of maintaining familial unity remains.[citation needed]

                    Although typical mooncakes can be around a few centimeters in diameter, imperial chefs have made
                    some as large as 8 meters in diameter, with their surface pressed with designs of Chang'e, cassia
                    trees, or the Moon Palace. One tradition is to pile 13 mooncakes on top of each other to mimic a
                    pagoda, the number 13 being chosen to represent the 13 months in a full Chinese lunisolar year. The
                    spectacle of making very large mooncakes continues in modern China.

                    According to Chinese folklore, a Turpan businessman offered cakes to Emperor Taizong of Tang in his
                    victory against the Xiongnu on the fifteenth day of the eighth Chinese lunisolar month. Taizong took
                    the round cakes and pointed to the moon with a smile, saying, "I'd like to invite the toad to enjoy
                    the hú (胡) cake." After sharing the cakes with his ministers, the custom of eating these hú cakes
                    spread throughout the country. Eventually these became known as mooncakes. Although the legend
                    explains the beginnings of mooncake-giving, its popularity and ties to the festival began during the
                    Song dynasty (906–1279 CE).

                    Another popular legend concerns the Han Chinese's uprising against the ruling Mongols at the end of
                    the Yuan dynasty (1280–1368 CE), in which the Han Chinese used traditional mooncakes to conceal the
                    message that they were to rebel on Mid-Autumn Day.[21] Because of strict controls upon Han Chinese
                    families imposed by the Mongols in which only 1 out of every 10 households was allowed to own a
                    knife guarded by a Mongolian, this coordinated message was important to gather as many available
                    weapons as possible.</p>

                <h2>The Story of Chang’e and Houyi</h2>
                <p>
                    Chang'e is a central character of Mid-Autumn Festival tradition. As Goddess of the Moon, she is
                    remembered during Mid-Autumn Festival, a.k.a. the Moon Festival.
