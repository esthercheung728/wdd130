        <h2>Esther Cheung</h2>
        <p>I live in Hong Kong with my oarent and a dog. In my spare time, I like watching movies, reading and
            travelling. I love learning, except BYU pathway course, I also take course in sign language and Japanese
            language. I
            hope one day I can communicate with others in different language.
            I am working in the accounting field. However, I found that there are a few bugs in the accounting system. I
            am thinking that is
            there any method that can decrease the error and increase the efficiency in my working place. After I took
            my first programming course, I found my interest. I want to learn more and one day I can use this skill to
            improve my job and help other people. I am looking forward to working with you all.</p>
