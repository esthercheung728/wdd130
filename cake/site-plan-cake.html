        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>On this website, my sister and I will express our enthusiasm for making cakes, bread, and desserts. And how
            the joy we find in them. Through our handmade cake photo,
            we want to share this happiness with visitors, especially individuals who have a food allergy to eggs and
            milk. They can rekindle their interest and hope in cakes
            If the visitors want to taste this happiness, they can find our contact information on this website.
        </p>
        <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>We want to focus on individuals who are celebrating special occasions. They are looking for customized cakes
            for events such as birthdays, engagements, anniversaries, graduations, baby showers, and other milestone
            celebrations. We also target families and individuals who enjoy home celebrations and smaller gatherings,
            such as family reunions, housewarming, and holidays. On the other hand, we welcome guests to order their own
            special cakes according to their special needs. For example, individuals who have a food allergy to egg
            and milk. We can make a special cake for them.</p> <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Home</h3>
        <p>
            The header shows our company logo and company name. We use a Lion color for the background of the header. We
            use gray color for the text. We want to create a feeling in the bakery. Then the next line shows the link
            for Home, Gallery, and Contact because the first line shows the company name. We do not have space to
            display the bottom in the first line.
            Then I would like to put the company's news or promotion or latest selling cake in the big image area. Under
            the new and promotion section, we show the main category of our product. They are bread, cake, and dessert.
            Next, we give a welcome message to visitors. Then we point our selling point on the Home Page. Our main
            selling point is catering to different dietary needs. We mainly use the fresh fruit to make the cake. I will
            put the fresh food or organic food photos here. For the welcome message’s photo and the selling point’s
            photo, we will place a color background under it.
            The lower side is the footer. We use blue color for the background and white color for the text. On the
            footer, it will show the company name again and display the icons which are IG, Facebook, email, and
            WhatsApp. I would like to set the link for these icons. We hope that our visitors can directly click the
            icon to contact us or check out our social media.

        <h3>Gallery</h3>
        <p>
            For the page of Gallery's header and footer, we use the same design as the Home Page. The header shows our
            company logo and company name in a Lion color. On the footer, it will show the company name again and
            display the icons which are IG, Facebook, email, and WhatsApp in blue background color. Then the next line
            shows the link for Home, Gallery, and Contact.
            There is some special of Gallery. I would like to add the Image Scroller in the big image area. It displays
            our top five or top ten cake, bread, and dessert photos. The lower area displays our products. We will put
            different photos in different categories in different areas. According to Visitor’s special needs, they can
            find the specific corner for their special cake, especially for weddings, anniversaries, graduations, and
            baby showers. We are still collecting the comments on our product. This page includes many photos. I will
            put the photos after I resize the photo size so that the visitor can open it easily. I will type brief
            product information under the photo, such as product name, amount, size, and any special allergenic
            materials. We will show it later on this page. As we want the visitor can see our product clearly, we will
            use a white background color.

            At this moment we only show the contact, including the email address, official working hours, and the phone
            number. It is because our shop is still an online shop. If the online store can break even, we will consider
            renting a store. In that time, we will show the map on it. And set up more pages for the website. For
            example, the order page, About us page, and FAQ page.
