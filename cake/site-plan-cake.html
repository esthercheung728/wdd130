        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>My sister and I want to build up a website to promote our hand-made cakes, bread and dessert. With the rise
            of online platforms and social media, targeting individuals who are active online can be beneficial. Engage
            with potential customers by sharing visually appealing cake photos, and posting tutorials or
            behind-the-scenes content. Through a website and online platforms to establish an online presence
            for visitors. They can contact us and leave us the message by using the website. As we are still testing our
            business by an online shore, it seems to be a good choice for us to promote our products. No need to find a
            location, rent a place and hire employee. We can open a new business at a reasonable cost on the internet
            and our guests can use the lower price to buy our products.</p>
        <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>We want to focus on individuals who are celebrating special occasions. They are looking for customized cakes
            for events such as birthdays, engagements, anniversaries, graduations, baby showers, and other milestone
            celebrations. We also target families and individuals who enjoy home celebrations and smaller gatherings,
            such as family reunions, housewarming, and holidays. On the other hand, we welcome guests to order their own
            special cakes according to their special needs. For example, individuals who have a food allergy to egg
            and milk. We can make a special cake for them.</p> <!-- change this -->

        <p>
            Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

        <h3>Home</h3>
        <p>
            The header shows our company logo and company name. We use a Lion color for the background of the header. We
            use gray color for the text. We want to create a feeling in the bakery. Then the next line shows the link
            for Home, Gallery, and Contact because the first line shows the company name. We do not have space to
            display the bottom in the first line.
            Then I would like to put the company's news or promotion or latest selling cake in the big image area. Under
            the new and promotion section, we show the main category of our product. They are bread, cake, and dessert.
            Next, we give a welcome message to visitors. Then we point our selling point on the Home Page. Our main
            selling point is catering to different dietary needs. We mainly use the fresh fruit to make the cake. I will
            put the fresh food or organic food photos here. For the welcome message’s photo and the selling point’s
            photo, we will place a color background under it.
            The lower side is the footer. We use blue color for the background and white color for the text. On the
            footer, it will show the company name again and display the icons which are IG, Facebook, email, and
            WhatsApp. I would like to set the link for these icons. We hope that our visitors can directly click the
            icon to contact us or check out our social media.


        </p>
        <img src="images/Home Page.png" alt="image for homepage">

        <h3>Gallery</h3>
        <p>
            For the page of Gallery's header and footer, we use the same design as the Home Page. The header shows our
            company logo and company name in a Lion color. On the footer, it will show the company name again and
            display the icons which are IG, Facebook, email, and WhatsApp in blue background color. Then the next line
            shows the link for Home, Gallery, and Contact.
            There is some special of Gallery. I would like to add the Image Scroller in the big image area. It displays
            our top five or top ten cake, bread, and dessert photos. The lower area displays our products. We will put
            different photos in different categories in different areas. According to Visitor’s special needs, they can
            find the specific corner for their special cake, especially for weddings, anniversaries, graduations, and
            baby showers. We are still collecting the comments on our product. This page includes many photos. I will
            put the photos after I resize the photo size so that the visitor can open it easily. I will type brief
            product information under the photo, such as product name, amount, size, and any special allergenic
            materials. We will show it later on this page. As we want the visitor can see our product clearly, we will
            use a white background color.
        </p>
        <img src="images/Gallery.png" alt="Logo image">

        <h3>Contact</h3>
        <p>
            The header shows our company logo and company name. We use a Lion color for the background of the header. We
            use gray color for the text. We want to create a feeling in the bakery. Then the next line shows the link
            for Home, Gallery, and Contact because the first line shows the company name. We do not have space to
            display the bottom in the first line. The lower side is the footer. We use blue color for the background and
            white color for the text. On the footer, it will show the company name again and display the icons which are
            IG, Facebook, email, and WhatsApp.
            At this moment we only show the contact, including the email address, official working hours, and the phone
            number. It is because our shop is still an online shop. If the online store can break even, we will consider
            renting a store. In that time, we will show the map on it. And set up more pages for the website. For
            example, the order page, About us page, and FAQ page.
